## Building
To build the whole thing, simply `mvn clean install`

## The tests
The tests are (obviously) in the test directory. Start either `SpringCornerApplication` or `AkkaCorner` and then run the `Head2HeadTester` to execute the test. Feel free to change parameters around and see what happens!
